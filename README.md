# Breast Cancer Prediction
Detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based on its characteristics.

# Dataset
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset available at (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original). It is a labelled dataset containing 699 rows of data with Class Labels 2 = benign and 4 = malignant.

# Model
The problem is considered as a binary classification problem and we use LogisticRegression classifier to do the predictions.

# Result
The accuracy of the final model is 96%.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
